# 🌐 COVID-19 Global Insight Lab  
🎯 Turning chaos into clarity with data-driven storytelling

---

## 📖 Overview  
When the world was overwhelmed with pandemic numbers, I decided to dig deeper—not just into the data, but into the story behind the spread.  
This project transforms a massive, unstructured global COVID-19 dataset into a clean, visual, and insightful narrative across **192 countries**.

Built using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**, this repository is a full package for any data analyst who believes in the power of numbers — not just to inform, but to inspire action.

## 🧭 Project Mission  
- 🌍 Understand the scale of the pandemic across different geographies  
- 📊 Analyze critical indicators like confirmed cases, mortality rate, and recoveries  
- 🗺️ Visualize the results in an interactive dashboard that even non-analysts can explore  

> _This project isn’t just about data. It’s about making data human._

## 🛠️ What I Did (and Loved Doing)  
✔️ Sourced global COVID-19 data from **Johns Hopkins University**  
✔️ Cleaned & structured it using **Python (Pandas)** and **Excel**  
✔️ Calculated KPIs like:
- 🧮 **Mortality Rate** = `(Total Deaths / Total Confirmed Cases) × 100`  
- 🩺 Recovery Rate, Active Cases, Incident Rate, UID Mapping  

✔️ Built a global dataset covering:  
- 192 Countries  
- Country Name, ISO Code, Latitude/Longitude  
- Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Mortality Rate  
- Last Updated Timestamp for Accuracy  

✔️ Designed an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** with:
- 🔥 Heatmaps of Impact  
- 📊 Bar Charts for Top 10 Affected Countries  
- 📈 Mortality vs. Recovery Visuals  
- 🔍 Drill-down Filters by Country & Region
